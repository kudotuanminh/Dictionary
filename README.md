# Dependencies

## Software

I use [_VSCode_](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) on Windows, compiled and packaged with [_Maven 3.8.2_](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi "	apache-maven-3.8.2").

## Compile and Run

### Compile

To compile, run:

```
mvn package
```

in _cmd_. _Maven_ will compiles and packages to `Dictionary-(program ver).jar` in `(root directory)/target/` path.

### Run

To execute either package you just compile, or one of the pre-compiled release in [Releases](https://github.com/kudotuanminh/Dictionary/releases), run:

```
java -jar Dictionary-(program ver).jar
```

in _cmd_.
